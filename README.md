# Day6-AnalystAgents

This project is designed by Juan Cesar Torres to analyze sales data using a modular approach with multiple analytical agents using the OpenAI Swarm Framework. Each agent specializes in a specific aspect of the analysis, including data quality assessment, channel performance evaluation, user behavior analysis, profitability metrics, and the generation of comprehensive insights. This project is made as part of the requirements at AI First Bootcamp by AI Republic. 

# Agent Descriptions

### 1. Data Quality Agent
- **Name**: data_quality_agent  
- **Model**: gpt-4o-mini  

**Description**:  
The Data Quality Agent is responsible for analyzing the dataset for quality metrics. It performs data cleaning operations, such as removing missing values and duplicates, and ensures that the dataset is ready for further analysis. The agent generates a report summarizing key data quality metrics, including the total number of rows, columns, missing values, and duplicates. This agent plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity of the data before any analytical processes are conducted.

### 2. Channel Growth Agent
- **Name**: channel_growth_agent  
- **Model**: gpt-4o-mini  

**Description**:  
The Channel Growth Agent analyzes the performance of various traffic sources (channels) in terms of revenue generation, ad spend, and transaction volumes. It provides insights into which channels are performing well and which are underperforming. The agent also offers actionable recommendations to optimize high-performing channels and improve overall marketing strategies. This agent is essential for understanding the effectiveness of different marketing channels and guiding resource allocation.

### 3. User Behavior Agent
- **Name**: user_behavior_agent  
- **Model**: gpt-4o-mini  

**Description**:  
The User Behavior Agent focuses on analyzing user behavior patterns across different devices. It evaluates metrics such as transaction volumes, conversion rates, and average order values for mobile and PC users. The agent provides insights into how users interact with the platform and identifies opportunities for enhancing user experience. Recommendations from this agent aim to improve engagement and conversion rates by tailoring strategies to user behavior.

### 4. Profitability Agent
- **Name**: profitability_agent  
- **Model**: gpt-4o-mini  

**Description**:  
The Profitability Agent assesses the profitability of marketing efforts by analyzing return on investment (ROI) metrics. It calculates total revenue, total ad spend, and ROI by source, identifying which channels are yielding positive returns and which are not. The agent provides insights into the financial performance of advertising campaigns and offers recommendations for optimizing ad spend. This agent is critical for ensuring that marketing investments are effective and contribute positively to the business's bottom line.

---

### 5. Insight Agent
- **Name**: insight_agent  
- **Model**: gpt-4o-mini  

**Description**:  
The Insight Agent synthesizes the outputs from the previous agents to generate comprehensive final insights. It combines data quality analysis, channel performance insights, user behavior analysis, and profitability metrics into a cohesive summary. The agent provides actionable recommendations based on the aggregated insights, helping stakeholders make informed decisions. This agent serves as the final step in the analysis process, ensuring that all relevant information is considered for strategic planning.

# Analysis Methodology Per Agent

### 1. Data Quality Analysis
- **Agent**: Data Quality Agent
- **Data Loading**: 
  - The agent begins by loading the dataset from a specified CSV file.
- **Data Cleaning**: 
  - Cleans the currency values in the revenue and ad spend columns by removing currency symbols and commas, converting them to float data types.
- **Quality Metrics Calculation**:
  - **Missing Values**: Checks for any missing values in the dataset and counts them.
  - **Duplicates**: Identifies and counts any duplicate records in the dataset.
  - **Row and Column Count**: Records the total number of rows and columns in the dataset.
- **Quality Report Generation**: 
  - Generates a report summarizing the data quality metrics, indicating the overall quality of the dataset.

---

### 2. Channel Performance Analysis
- **Agent**: Channel Growth Agent
- **Data Loading**: 
  - Loads the cleaned dataset.
- **Metric Calculation**:
  - **Revenue by Source**: Calculates the total revenue generated by each traffic source using the `groupby` method.
  - **Ad Spend by Source**: Calculates the total ad spend for each source similarly.
  - **Transactions by Source**: Computes the total number of transactions attributed to each source.
- **Insights Generation**: 
  - Compiles the calculated metrics into a structured format, providing insights into channel performance.

---

### 3. User Behavior Analysis
- **Agent**: User Behavior Agent
- **Data Loading**: 
  - Loads the cleaned dataset.
- **Behavior Metrics Calculation**:
  - **Device Performance**: Calculates the average transactions and revenue for each device type (e.g., mobile, PC) using the `groupby` method.
  - **Conversion Rate**: Calculates the conversion rate for each device type by dividing the total transactions by the total visits.
  - **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Computes the average order value by dividing the total revenue by the total transactions for each device type.
- **Insights Generation**: 
  - Summarizes the calculated metrics and provides insights into user behavior patterns across different devices.

---

### 4. Profitability Analysis
- **Agent**: Profitability Agent
- **Data Loading**: 
  - Loads the cleaned dataset.
- **Profitability Metrics Calculation**:
  - **ROI by Source**: Calculates the return on investment (ROI) for each traffic source by aggregating total revenue and total ad spend, then computing the ROI using the formula:
    \[
    \text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Ad Spend}}{\text{Total Ad Spend}}
    \]
  - **Total Revenue and Ad Spend**: Computes the overall total revenue and total ad spend for the entire dataset.
  - **Overall ROI**: Calculates the overall ROI for the business using the total revenue and total ad spend.
- **Insights Generation**: 
  - Compiles the profitability metrics and provides insights into the financial performance of the marketing efforts.

### 5. Insight Generation
- **Agent**: Insight Agent
- **Data Aggregation**: 
  - Collects insights from the previous analyses (data quality, channel performance, user behavior, and profitability).
- **Final Insights Compilation**: 
  - Generates a comprehensive summary that includes:
    - Data quality analysis results.
    - Channel performance insights.
