# Day6-AnalystAgents

This project is designed by Juan Cesar Torres to analyze sales data using a modular approach with multiple analytical agents using the OpenAI Swarm Framework. Each agent specializes in a specific aspect of the analysis, including data quality assessment, channel performance evaluation, user behavior analysis, profitability metrics, and the generation of comprehensive insights. This project is made as part of the requirements at AI First Bootcamp by AI Republic. 

# Agent Descriptions

### 1. Data Quality Agent
- **Name**: data_quality_agent  
- **Model**: gpt-4o-mini  

**Description**:  
The Data Quality Agent is responsible for analyzing the dataset for quality metrics. It performs data cleaning operations, such as removing missing values and duplicates, and ensures that the dataset is ready for further analysis. The agent generates a report summarizing key data quality metrics, including the total number of rows, columns, missing values, and duplicates. This agent plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity of the data before any analytical processes are conducted.

### 4. Profitability Agent
- **Name**: profitability_agent  
- **Model**: gpt-4o-mini  

**Description**:  
The Profitability Agent assesses the profitability of marketing efforts by analyzing return on investment (ROI) metrics. It calculates total revenue, total ad spend, and ROI by source, identifying which channels are yielding positive returns and which are not. The agent provides insights into the financial performance of advertising campaigns and offers recommendations for optimizing ad spend. This agent is critical for ensuring that marketing investments are effective and contribute positively to the business's bottom line.

     - **Cityads**: 11,904 transactions
   - **Zero Transactions**: Both Baidu and YouTube have no recorded transactions.

### Recommendations

1. **Reassess Underperforming Channels**:
   - **Baidu and YouTube**:
     - Investigate reasons for inactivity; consider reallocating budgets to channels that are performing better.
     - If these channels are critical for brand visibility, re-evaluate content strategy or ad targeting.

2. **Optimize High-Spend, Low-Return Channels**:
   - Although Google and Facebook are generating revenue, the ratio of ad spend to revenue should be analyzed to ascertain profitability.
   - Consider reducing spend on sub-performing sources like Cityads unless they provide strategic long-term value.

3. **Leverage High-Performing Channels**:
   - **Google and Facebook** should receive focused marketing efforts to maximize returns on ad spend.
   - Tiktok shows potential with a significant number of transactions; strategies should be developed to further enhance its growth.

4. **A/B Testing**:
   - Use A/B testing on channels like Instagram and Tiktok, which have decent revenue but may offer opportunities for further optimization in ad spend effectiveness.

5. **Explore Emerging Platforms**:
   - Since social media trends are changing rapidly, investigate and experiment with new platforms to capture emerging audiences effectively (e.g., newer features on TikTok, or platforms like Snapchat).

By strategically focusing efforts based on these insights, you can enhance channel performance and drive overall growth.

User Behavior Analysis Insights:
Based on the analysis of user behavior patterns, we have the following insights:

### Device Performance Insights:
1. **Transactions and Revenue by Device:**
   - **PC:**
     - Transactions: 18,233
     - Revenue: $123,892
   - **Mobile:**
     - Transactions: 21,177
     - Revenue: $126,358
   - **No Data:**
     - Transactions: 23,029
     - Revenue: $148,566

2. **Conversion Rates by Device:**
   - **PC:** 18.25%
   - **Mobile:** 12.75%
   - **No Data:** 34.82%

3. **Average Order Value by Device:**
   - **PC:** $6,794.86
   - **Mobile:** $5,966.77
   - **No Data:** $6,451.31

### Key Insights:
- The **mobile device** has the highest number of transactions but a lower conversion rate compared to PC. This could suggest that while more users are browsing and purchasing on mobile, they may not be as committed or are facing barriers to completing purchases.
- The **PC** users, despite fewer transactions, have a significantly higher average order value, indicating that users on this platform are spending more on average.
- A notable proportion of transactions is coming from users with "no data," which might represent a significant opportunity for capturing more insights if data collection can be improved.

### Recommendations:
1. **Enhance Mobile Experience:** Since mobile transactions are high, it may be beneficial to optimize the mobile user experience, addressing any barriers to completion that may exist to improve the conversion rate.

2. **Targeted Marketing Strategies:** Leverage the high average order value from PC users by developing targeted marketing strategies that entice them to increase transaction frequency.

3. **Data Collection Improvements:** Focused efforts to improve data collection from users labeled as "no data" could unlock new insights into customer behavior, potentially leading to better-targeted marketing and higher conversions.

4. **User Engagement Initiatives:** Implement initiatives to recognize and engage mobile users, possibly through personalized promotions or browser incentives to convert them into high-value customers.

By addressing these areas, we can enhance user engagement, increase conversion rates, and ultimately boost revenue.

Profitability Analysis Insights:
Based on the profitability metrics analyzed, here are some key insights and recommendations:

### Insights:
1. **Overall Return on Investment (ROI)**: The overall ROI is -0.77, indicating that the company is losing approximately 77 cents for every dollar 
spent on advertising. This is a significant negative performance and needs urgent attention.

2. **Total Revenue vs. Total Ad Spend**: The total revenue is approximately 6.72 billion, while total ad spend is about 28.97 billion. This disparity leads to a negative ROI and highlights inefficiencies in the current marketing strategy.

3. **ROI by Source**: The ROI from various advertising sources is predominantly negative, with several sources showing particularly poor performance:
   - **Worst Performing Sources**:
     - Baidu: -1.00
     - YouTube: -1.00
     - Bing: -0.994511
     - Actionpay: -0.993092
     - Others like Facebook, DuckDuckGo, and Instagram are also significantly negative.

4. **Moderately Performing Sources**: Although still negative, sources like:
   - Facebook: -0.654767
   - TikTok: -0.849873
   show less severe losses but still require improvement.

### Recommendations:
1. **Re-evaluate Advertising Channels**: Immediate action is needed to assess and likely discontinue or refine spending on the least effective channels - such as Baidu and YouTube - which have shown a total loss on investment.

2. **Optimize Remaining Channels**: Focus on optimizing moderately performing channels like Facebook and TikTok. This could include better-targeted ad campaigns, A/B testing for creatives, and improving landing pages to enhance conversion rates.

3. **Implement a Performance Monitoring System**: Establish robust metrics to track the performance of each advertising channel continuously. Regular monitoring will help identify which channels to invest in or pull back from in a more timely manner.

4. **Consider Creative Strategy Adjustments**: Invest in improving ad creative and messaging across all platforms. Effective creative can sometimes dramatically influence ROI.

5. **Conduct A/B Testing**: Experiment with different forms of advertisements on platforms that are slightly better (like Facebook and TikTok) to find what resonates more with the audience.

6. **Explore Cost Reduction Opportunities**: Evaluate the cost structures involved in ad placements. Finding more cost-effective channels or negotiating better rates with current ones could improve ROI.

By focusing on these recommendations, the organization can work towards improving its overall profitability and reducing losses from advertising expenditures.
